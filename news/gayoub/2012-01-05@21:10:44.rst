Radicale 0.6.4, News from Calypso
=================================

New year, new release. Radicale 0.6.4 has a really short changelog:


0.6.4 - Tulips
--------------

* Fix the installation with Python 3.1

The bug was in fact caused by a `bug in Python 3.1
<http://bugs.python.org/issue9561>`_, everything should be OK now.


Calypso
-------

After a lot of changes in Radicale, Keith Packard has decided to launch a fork
called `Calypso <http://keithp.com/blogs/calypso/>`_, with nice features such
as a Git storage mechanism and a CardDAV support.

There are lots of differences between the two projects, but the final goal for
Radicale is to provide these new features as soon as possible. Thanks to the
work of Keith and other people on GitHub, a basic CardDAV support has been
added in the `carddav branch <https://github.com/Kozea/Radicale/tree/carddav>`_
and already works with Evolution. Korganizer also works with existing address
books, and CardDAV-Sync will be tested soon. If you want to test other clients,
please let us know!
