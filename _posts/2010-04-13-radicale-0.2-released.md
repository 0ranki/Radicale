---

Radicale 0.2 is out! Here is whatâ€™s new:

### 0.2 - Snowflakes

* Sunbird pre-1.0 support
* SSL connection
* Htpasswd authentication
* Daemon mode
* User configuration
* Twisted dependency removed
* Python 3 support
* Real URLs for PUT and DELETE
* Concurrent modification reported to users
* Many bugs fixed by Roger Wenham

First of all, we would like to thank Roger Wenham for his bugfixes and his
supercool words.

You may have noticed that Sunbird 1.0 has not been released, but according to
the Mozilla developers, 1.0pre is something like a final version.

You may have noticed too that Radicale can be
[downloaded from PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Radicale/0.2). Of course, it
is also available on the [download page](/download/).
