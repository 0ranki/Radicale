Regex-based rights.

Regexes are read from a file whose name is specified in the config (section
"right", key "file").

Authentication login is matched against the "user" key, and collection's path
is matched against the "collection" key. You can use Python's ConfigParser
interpolation values %(login)s and %(path)s. You can also get groups from the
user regex in the collection with {0}, {1}, etc.

Section names are only used for naming the rule.

Leading or ending slashes are trimmed from collection's path.

Examples:

# This means all users starting with "admin" may read any collection
[admin]
user: ^admin.*\|.+?$
collection: .*
permission: r

# This means all users may read and write any collection starting with public.
# We do so by just not testing against the user string.
[public]
user: .*
collection: ^public(/.+)?$
permission: rw

# A little more complex: give read access to users from a domain for all
# collections of all the users (ie. user@domain.tld can read domain/*).
[domain-wide-access]
user: ^.+@(.+)\..+$
collection: ^{0}/.+$
permission: r

# Allow authenticated user to read all collections
[allow-everyone-read]
user: .*
collection: .*
permission: r

# Give write access to owners
[owner-write]
user: .*
collection: ^%(login)s/.+$
permission: w
