title: News from Radicale
---

During the last weeks, Radicale has not been idle, even if no news have been
posted since August. Thanks to Pete, Pierre-Philipp and Andrew, we're trying to
add a better support on MacOS, Windows and mobile devices like iPhone and
Android-based phones.

All the tests on Windows have been successful: launching Radicale and using
Lightning as client works without any problems. On Android too, some testers
have reported clients working with Radicale. These were the good news.

The bad news come from Apple: both iPhone and MacOS default clients are not
working yet, despite the latest enhancements given to the PROPFIND
requests. The problems are quite hard to debug due to our lack of Apple
hardware, but Pete is helping us in this difficult quest! Radicale 0.5 will be
out as soon as these two clients are working.

Some cool stuff is coming next, with calendar collections and groups, and a
simple web-based CalDAV client in early development. Stay tuned!
