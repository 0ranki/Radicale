title: Lightning and Sunbird 1.0b2pre Support
---

Lightning/Sunbird 1.0b2pre is out, adding minor changes in CalDAV support. A
[new commit](http://www.gitorious.org/radicale/radicale/commit/330283e) makes
Radicale work with versions 0.9, 1.0b1 et 1.0b2. Moreover, etags are now quoted
according to the RFC 2616.
