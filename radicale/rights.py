Rights backends.

This module loads the rights backend, according to the rights
configuration.

Default rights are based on a regex-based file whose name is specified in the
config (section "right", key "file").

Authentication login is matched against the "user" key, and collection's path
is matched against the "collection" key. You can use Python's ConfigParser
interpolation values %(login)s and %(path)s. You can also get groups from the
user regex in the collection with {0}, {1}, etc.

For example, for the "user" key, ".+" means "authenticated user" and ".*"
means "anybody" (including anonymous users).

Section names are only used for naming the rule.

Leading or ending slashes are trimmed from collection's path.
