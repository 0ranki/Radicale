Radicale 0.10 is out!


###0.10 - Lovely Endless Grass

* Support well-known URLs (by Mathieu Dupuy)
* Fix collection discovery (by Markus Unterwaditzer)
* Reload logger config on SIGHUP (by Ã‰lie Bouttier)
* Remove props files when deleting a collection (by Vincent Untz)
* Support salted SHA1 passwords (by Marc Kleine-Budde)
* Don't spam the logs about non-SSL IMAP connections to localhost (by Giel van Schijndel)

This version should bring some interesting discovery and auto-configuration
features, mostly with Apple clients.

Lots of love and kudos for the people who have spent hours to test features and
report issues, that was long but really useful (and some of you have been
really patient :p).

Issues are welcome, I'm sure that you'll find horrible, terrible, crazy bugs
faster than me. I'll release a version 0.10.1 if needed.

What's next? It's time to fix and improve the storage methods. A real API for
the storage modules is a good beginning, many pull requests are already ready
to be discussed and merged, and we will probably get some good news about
performance this time. Who said "databases, please"?
