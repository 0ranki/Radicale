Evolution Supported
===================

Radicale now supports another CalDAV client: `Evolution, the default mail,
addressbook and calendaring client for Gnome
<http://projects.gnome.org/evolution/>`_.  This feature was quite easy to add,
as it required less than 20 new lines of code in the requests handler.

If you are interested, just clone the `git repository
<http://www.gitorious.org/radicale/radicale>`_.
