title: Jabber Room and iPhone Support
---

After a lot of help and testing work from Andrew, Bj√∂rn, Anders, Dorian and
Pete (and other ones we could have forgotten), a simple iPhone support has been
added in the git repository. If you are interested, you can test this feature
*right now* by
[downloading the latest git version](http://radicale.org/download#git-repository)
(a tarball is even available too if you don't want or know how to use git).

No documentation has been written yet, but using the right URL in the
configuration should be enough to synchronize your calendars. If you have any
problems, you can ask by joining our new Jabber room:
radicale@room.jabber.kozea.fr.

Radicale 0.5 will be released as soon as the iCal support is ready. If you have
an Apple computer, Python skills and some time to spend, we'd be glad to help
you debugging Radicale.
