Radicale 0.7.1
==============

Radicale 0.7.1 is out!


0.7.1 - Waterfalls
------------------

* Many address books fixes
* New IMAP ACL (by Daniel Aleksandersen)
* PAM ACL fixed (by Daniel Aleksandersen)
* Courier ACL fixed (by Benjamin Frank)
* Always set display name to collections (by Oskari Timperi)
* Various DELETE responses fixed

It's been a long time since the last version… As usual, many people have
contributed to this new version, that's a pleasure to get these pull requests.

Most of the commits are bugfixes, especially about ACL backends and address
books. Many clients (including aCal and SyncEvolution) will be much happier
with this new version than with the previous one.

By the way, one main new feature has been added: a new IMAP ACL backend, by
Daniel. And about authentication, exciting features are coming soon, stay
tuned!

Next time, as many mails have come from angry and desperate coders, tests will
be *finally* added to help them to add features and fix bugs. And after that,
who knows, it may be time to release Radicale 1.0…
