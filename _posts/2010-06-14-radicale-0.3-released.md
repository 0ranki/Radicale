title: Radicale 0.3 Released
---

Radicale 0.3 is out! Here is what’s new:

### 0.3 - Dancing Flowers

* Evolution support
* Version management

The website changed a little bit too, with some small HTML5 and CSS3 features
such as articles, sections, transitions, opacity, box shadows and rounded
corners. If you’re reading this website with Internet Explorer, you should
consider using a standard-compliant browser!

Radicale is now included in Squeeze, the testing branch of Debian. A
[Radicale ebuild for Gentoo](http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=322811) has
been proposed too. If you want to package Radicale for another distribution,
you’re welcome!

Next step is 0.5, with calendar collections, and Windows and MacOS support.
