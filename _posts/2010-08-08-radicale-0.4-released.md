title: Radicale 0.4 Released
---

Radicale 0.4 is out! Here is what's new:

###0.4 - Hot Days Back

* Personal calendars
* HEAD requests 
* Last-Modified HTTP header
* ``no-ssl`` and ``foreground`` options
* Default configuration file

This release has mainly been released to help our dear packagers to include a default configuration file and to write init scripts. Big thanks to Necoro for his work on the new Gentoo ebuild!
