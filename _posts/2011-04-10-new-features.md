title: New Features
---

Radicale 0.5 was released only 8 days ago, but 3 new features have already been
added to the master branch:

- IPv6 support, with multiple addresses/ports support
- Logs and debug mode
- Owner-less calendars

Most of the code has been written by Necoro and Corentin, and that was not easy
at all: Radicale is now multithreaded! For sure, you can find many bugs and
report them on the
[bug tracker](http://redmine.kozea.fr/projects/radicale/issues). And if you're
fond of logging, you can even add a default configuration file and more debug
messages in the source.
