Radicale 0.5 Released
=====================

Radicale 0.5 is out! Here is what's new:

0.5 - Historical Artifacts
--------------------------

* Calendar depth
* iPhone support
* MacOS and Windows support
* HEAD requests management
* htpasswd user from calendar path

iPhone support, but no iCal support for 0.5, despite our hard work, sorry!
After 1 month with no more activity on the dedicated bug, it was time to forget
it and hack on new awesome features. Thanks for your help, dear Apple users, I
keep the hope that one day, Radicale will work with you!

So, what's next? As promised, some cool git branches will soon be merged, with
LDAP support, logging, IPv6 and anonymous calendars. Sounds pretty cool, heh?
Talking about new features, more and more people are asking for a CardDAV
support in Radicale. `A git branch
<https://www.gitorious.org/~deepdiver/radicale/deepdivers-radicale>`_ and `a
feature request <http://redmine.kozea.fr/issues/247>`_ are open, feel free to
hack and discuss.
