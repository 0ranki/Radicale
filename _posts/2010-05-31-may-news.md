### News from contributors

Jonas Smedegaard packaged Radicale for Debian last week. Two packages, called
``radicale`` for the daemon and ``python-radicale`` for the module, have been
added to Sid, the unstable branch of Debian. Thank you, Jonas!

Sven Guckes corrected some of the strange-English-sentences present on this
website. Thank you, Sven!

### News from software

A simple ``VERSION`` has been added in the library: you can now play with
``radicale.VERSION`` and ``$radicale --version``.

After playing with the version (should not be too long), you may notice that
the next version is called 0.3, and not 0.5 as previously decided. The 0.3 main
goal is to offer the support for Evolution as soon as possible, without waiting
for the 0.5. After more than a month of test, we corrected all the bugs we
found and everything seems to be fine; we can imagine that a brand new tarball
will be released during the first days of June.
